# Running the Code
this is how you run the code: \
Disclaimer: make sure to run the "make clear" command on the terminal to run the code smoothly as instructed 
```
make run
./main.o
``` 
and after that, this should appear \
RED Light State: \

\
the machine goes into another state automatically so it will count a time for the states to run out of time until it expires and goes to the next state
\
after the Red state it will go to the next state 

RED + AMBER state: \

GREEN state: \
<img width="422" alt="Screenshot_20230104_121118" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114371873/210409450-b914fb9c-72c5-4f68-8a3f-2d92963bfcf2.png">

AMBER state: \
<img width="541" alt="Screenshot_20230104_121140" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114371873/210409677-72893dfe-80b5-4efd-b9e5-61abb171aa89.png">

once the machine goes to the AMBER state and then it expires it will go back to the RED state and repeats the cycle until Judgment day(or you turn it off of course).
